Product Development & Applications Engineer – Plastic Films
** Involves travel up to 50% **


LOCATION: Greater Atlanta, SW side. 1 hour + drive from downtown.


Pay: $71K-108K depending on experience. Pay range coincides with 5-15 yrs of experience


Appropriate Plastics Backgrounds: Blown film extrusion, cast film, film web handling, converting and flexographic backgrounds welcome.


Appropriate Titles Held: Will consider process engineers and new product development engineers who are willing to take on a travel-based role OR a someone recently in an applications engineering role.


THE COMPANY
This is your chance to work with a global, flexible plastic packaging company providing high level engineering support at this Georgia plant.  The company has manufacturing on 3 continents. They extrude plastic films, have coating and converting processes. There are around 280 employees in this one facility. Being hired in this role will allow for advancement into the business & sales, engineering, and operations sides of the company as it gives you experience in multiple angles of the industry.
 
THE JOB
This job is the liaison among sales, R&D, and production. You will travel with the sales team to many customer locations in efforts to provide a technical / engineering and creative voice in discussions related to new business. You will have the direct, technical support of a technology manager on-site.  Since the plant is in growth mode, this role will wear more hats than roles at larger companies like Mactac, Bemis, Printpack, Berry Plastics, etc. E.g. you might find yourself elbow deep with trial runs then flying out to a customer site the next day.  The involvement with the sales team and customers will be rather typical of an applications engineer role in the films industry. Your role will interact with the sales crew that is growing a portion of the company portfolio that is not considered this plant’s ‘core product,’ but are also not uncharted waters. Much of the team interaction you will have will be with sales and customers, on the floor, running trials, testing products, and designing experiments to work out the kinks in new product trials. Desk work will include data management (BOM, routings, costing), patent research, quality and specification planning, and preparing presentations.

3+ years in a similar role at a films manufacturing plant. Blown film extrusion preferred, might consider a films converting / coating / web handling background. 
Titles held: it is fine to have been a process engineer or new product development engineer who is willing to step into a travel-based role. 
Lean Six Sigma trained – preferred. Certification not required.

You can travel consistently between 25% - 50% without obstacles.

Phase One Duties:

Move Applications, Services and Scheduled Tasks from a Server 2003 environment to a Server 2016 environment and document everything about the applications and systems. These environments include Development, Staging, and Production servers.

There are roughly 35 classic ASP applications and a few .Net applications. Most have already been migrated to the development server and the information about them documented. The applications on the development server need to go through the QA process, then moving them to staging can occur. 


Phase Two Duties:

Phase two of the project is rewriting the Classic ASP applications in .Net. This phase has already been started with the Application Security app. There are about 35 applications in total. This phase has not been estimated for time, but may take several months, including QA time. There is a priority for the applications. The smaller applications may not need to be converted, but that is contingent on time.
