Dell, which effectively owns more than 80 percent of VMWare, will receive about US$9 billion, the people added.The remainder of the consideration for the VWWare tracking stock holders will be financed with common equity in Dell, which will remain a private company, the people said.Dell will not make any immediate moves to buy out the shareholders of the publicly traded VMWare stock, who will continue to own just under 20 percent of the company, the people said.The Wall Street Journal first reported news that talks to buy out the tracking stock shareholders were in advanced stages.(Reporting by Carl O'Donnell; Editing by David Gregorio)\",\n",
       " \"EU 'possibly as bad as China' on trade: Trump \": 'WASHINGTON: Europe is \"possibly as bad as China\" on trade, US President Donald Trump said in an interview broadcast on Sunday (Jul 1), with trade wars emerging against both the Asian giant as well as longtime allies in Europe and Canada.\"The European Union is possibly as bad as China, only smaller,\" Trump said on Fox News\\' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" programme.\"They send a Mercedes in, we can\\'t send our cars in. Look what they do to our farmers. They don\\'t want our farm products. Now in all fairness they have their farmers ... But we don\\'t protect ours and they protect theirs,\" he said.Trump had already threatened tariffs on cars imported from the European Union, in response to the EU\\'s retaliatory tariffs last week on iconic US products including bourbon, jeans and motorcycles.The EU retaliation came after Trump\\'s administration on Jun\\xa01 struck Europe as well as allies in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere with tariffs on aluminum and steel.Canada\\'s retaliatory tariffs take effect on Sunday against American products including Florida orange juice, ketchup and Kentucky bourbon.Canada and the US are among the world\\'s largest trading partners, with an estimated US$673.9 billion in goods and services exchanged in 2017, with the US scoring a small surplus (US$8.4 billion), according to US government data.At Trump\\'s insistence, Canada, Mexico and the US are renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement.\"NAFTA, I could sign it tomorrow but I\\'m not happy with it. I want to make it more fair, OK?\" Trump said, adding that he wants to wait until \"after the election.\"Trump\\'s Republicans are fighting to retain control of Congress in November midterm elections.In the interview the president again complained about Canada\\'s protected dairy industry, saying \"that\\'s not fair.\"Against China, the world\\'s second-largest economy, the White House in mid-June announced stiff 25 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports, sparking immediate retaliation from Beijing.Trump on Wednesday said he supported tougher restrictions on foreign investment in sensitive technology, as well as export controls on those goods, but he stopped short of imposing specific restrictions on China.Asked about that decision, Trump said in the interview that he is not backing down on China tariffs.\"No, no, no, no,\" he said, noting that more tariffs could be imposed if there is no deal with China.\"I will tell you, China wants to make a deal and so do I, but it\\'s got to be a fair deal for this country,\" he said.The US has complained about Chinese policies that Washington said either forced companies to relinquish key technology or allowed China to steal it outright.The president announced 25 per cent import tariffs on hundreds of Chinese products to pressure the country to alter its practices. Those tariffs are due to take effect Jul\\xa06.That came on top of the tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium that went into effect in late March -\\xa0measures that prompted Beijing to slap punitive duties on 128 US goods, including pork, wine and certain pipes.',\n",
       " 'Tesla hits Model 3 manufacturing milestone, hours after deadline': 'SAN FRANCISCO: Tesla Inc nearly produced 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans in the last week of its second quarter, with the final car rolling off the assembly line on Sunday (Jul 1) morning, several hours after the midnight goal set by Chief Executive Elon Musk, two workers at the factory told Reuters.The 5,000th car finished final quality checks at the Fremont, California factory and was ready to go around 5.00am\\xa0(1200 GMT), one person said. It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period of time.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla had a goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery-powered sedan.Money-losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3, and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla\\'s first-to-market position for a mid-priced, long-range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles.Production of the Model 3 has been plagued by a number of issues, including problems with an over-reliance on automation on its assembly lines, battery issues and other bottlenecks.As the end of the quarter neared, Musk spurred on workers, built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory, and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target, including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter.\"It was pretty hectic,\" said one worker who described the atmosphere as \"all hands on deck.\"Another worker speaking after the 5,000th car was made described the factory as a \"mass celebration.\"Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week, and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end-of-quarter production speed.The company regularly engages in so-called \"burst builds,\" temporary periods of fast-as-possible production, which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time.Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief \"burst rates\" of Model 3 production that were not sustainable.Tesla said in May that its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter.Despite touting the Model 3 as a US$35,000 vehicle, Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher-priced version. It is not clear how many of the orders are for the higher-priced versions.Tesla in January pushed back its target date for building 5,000 vehicles per week to the end of the second quarter, the latest in several delays that have concerned some investors.Steady progress has enthused others, however, and Tesla\\'s market value is close to that of General Motors Co. The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year.June was turbulent for Tesla. It laid off nine per cent of its workforce, endured at least two fires at its Fremont, California plant and accused a former employee of engaging in sabotage for speaking to the media. The ex-worker claims he is a whistleblower.In early June, Musk said it was \"quite likely\" that Tesla could deliver 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of quarter. At the time, Tesla was producing 3,500 of the vehicles per week, he said.As the end of June approached, workers told Reuters that the company was building fewer than its 5,000-per week goal.'}"

They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.One day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.“This is amazing,” he said. “I’ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you’re the 100% perfect girl for me.”“And you,” she said to him, “are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I’d pictured you in every detail. It’s like a dream.”They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It’s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.As they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one’s dreams to come true so easily?And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, “Let’s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other’s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we’ll marry then and there. What do you think?”“Yes,” she said, “that is exactly what we should do.”And so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other’s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.One winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season’s terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence’s piggy bank.They were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.Time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.One beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:She is the 100% perfect girl for me.He is the 100% perfect boy for me.But the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier.
